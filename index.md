# About

<img align="right" src="assets/images/pzivich_headshot_2023.jpg" alt="Me" width="300">

Dr. Paul Zivich is a research assistant professor in the Department of Epidemiology at University of North Carolina at 
Chapel Hill. His interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, infectious disease prevention and 
computational aspects of epidemiology. His work has ranged from assessing the performance of estimators through 
simulation studies to free and open source software (FOSS) to collection of contact network data with electronic 
sensors to application of causal inference in the context of infectious disease and social epidemiology.

Paul received his PhD in epidemiology from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his MPH in 
epidemiology from The Ohio State University. He was born, is conducting research, and will die.

## Current Research

The following is a brief summary of my ongoing research projects or current research interests.

### Non-standard causal inference

When first taught causal inference, many associate it directly with rote memorization of the standard identification 
assumptions of causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity. Others associate it with specific estimation methods
(e.g., inverse probability weighting). However, causal inference is so much more. 

One major area of my on-going research is in these 'non-standard' areas of causal inference. Examples of my work in 
this area include: 
[synthesis modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01572) to address violations of the positivity assumption,
use of [proximal causal inference](https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aje/kwad077/7098281) to 
account for unmeasured confounding variables, 
[data fusion](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39218437/) to integrate information across data sources, 
[machine learning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012235/) to weaken modeling assumptions, 
and [causal inference with interference](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.9525). 

### Estimating equations

During my postdoc, I began to study estimating equations. After understanding this approach, it has changed how I 
approach my research. I have found estimating equations to be a set of powerful tools for statistical analyses. This
has simplified by methodological work (by making proofs on statistical properties simpler) and applied work (by 
allowing me to avoid bootstrapping). My ongoing interest is in furthering these tools for epidemiologic analyses and 
to ease their adoption by epidemiologists. 

My primary contribution in this area has been the development of [delicatessen](https://deli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), 
a Python library for general application of estimating equations. Other examples of my work in this area include
[introductory materials](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38423105/) developed for epidemiologists, 
extensions for g-computation with [marginal structural models](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39191643/) or
[time-varying confounding](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39489722/),
use with [sensitivity analyses](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/9900/Sensitivity_Analyses_for_Means_or_Proportions_with.139.aspx),
and fusion designs [generally](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/192/3/467/6564140) 
and for [bridged treatment comparisons](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38110289/).

### Infectious diseases

My applied work focuses mainly on infectious disease epidemiology. Previous and ongoing research have focused on 
[HIV](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37969014/), 
[influenza](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/9p290j79m),
[pneumonia](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41479-018-0055-4),
[SARS-CoV-2](https://www.researchprotocols.org/2021/4/e25410), 
[testing strategies](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/192/2/246/6759402),
and 
[vaccines](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10995-016-2201-z).
