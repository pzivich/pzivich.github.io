# About

<img align="right" src="assets/images/paul_zivich_min.JPG" alt="Me" width="36">

I am a postdoctoral trainee at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Institute of Global Health and 
Infectious Diseases. My interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, with 
specialization in the context of networks and contagious outcomes (e.g. infectious diseases, health behaviors, etc.). 
I also focus on computational aspects of epidemiology. My work has ranged from assessing the 
performance of estimators through simulation studies to collection of contact network data with electronic sensors to 
application of causal inference in the context of infectious disease and social epidemiology. 

I received my PhD in epidemiology from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and my MPH in 
epidemiology from The Ohio State University. 

My website provides a highlighted selection of publications, presentations, and software I have written. For a full 
summary of all my previous work, please see my CV.
