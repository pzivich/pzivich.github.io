# Paul Zivich

I am a doctoral candidate in epidemiology at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with an MPH in epidemiology from The Ohio State 
University. My interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, particularly in the context of networks and contagious outcomes 
(e.g. infectious diseases, health behaviors). My work has ranged from assessing the performance of estimators through simulation studies 
to collection of contact network data with electronic sensors to application of causal inference in the context of infectious 
disease and social epidemiology. I am also the creator of the [zEpid](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid) Python 3.x library, a free-software 
library for epidemiologic analyses and quantitative causal inference.

Analytic code for applicable articles is also available [here](https://github.com/pzivich/publications-code)
