# Paul Zivich

I am a postdoctoral research associate at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Causal Inference Research
Lab. I recieved my PhD in epidemiology from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and an MPH in epidemiology 
from The Ohio State University. My interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, with a special focus in 
the context of networks and contagious outcomes (e.g. infectious diseases, health behaviors). I also specialize in 
computational aspects of epidemiology. My work has ranged from assessing the performance of estimators through 
simulation studies to collection of contact network data with electronic sensors to application of causal inference 
in the context of infectious disease and social epidemiology. I am also the creator of the 
[zEpid](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid) Python 3.x library, a free-software library for epidemiologic analyses and 
quantitative causal inference.
