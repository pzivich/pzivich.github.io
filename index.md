# About

I am a postdoctoral research associate at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Causal Inference Research
Lab. I received my PhD in epidemiology from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and my MPH in epidemiology
from The Ohio State University. My interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, with specialization in
the context of networks and contagious outcomes (e.g. infectious diseases, health behaviors, etc.). Additionally, I
work on fusion problems. I also focus on computational aspects of epidemiology. My work has ranged from assessing the 
performance of estimators through simulation studies to collection of contact network data with electronic sensors to 
application of causal inference in the context of infectious disease and social epidemiology. 

My website provides a highlighted selection of publications, presentations, and software I have written. For a summary
of all my previous work, please see my CV.
