About Me
=====

I am a postdoctoral research associate at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Causal Inference Research
Lab. I received my PhD in epidemiology from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and an MPH in epidemiology
from The Ohio State University. My interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, with a special focus in
the context of networks and contagious outcomes (e.g. infectious diseases, health behaviors). I also specialize in
computational aspects of epidemiology. My work has ranged from assessing the performance of estimators through
simulation studies to collection of contact network data with electronic sensors to application of causal inference
in the context of infectious disease and social epidemiology. I am the creator of the
[zEpid](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid) Python 3.5+ library, a free-software library for epidemiologic analyses and
quantitative causal inference, and [delicatessen](https://github.com/pzivich/Delicatessen), a Python 3.6+ library for
generalized M-estimation.

Analytic code for applicable articles is also available [here](https://github.com/pzivich/publications-code)
