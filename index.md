# About

<img align="right" src="assets/images/paul_zivich_min.JPG" alt="Me" width="300">

I am a postdoctoral trainee at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Institute of Global Health and 
Infectious Diseases. My interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, with specialization in the context 
of networks and contagious outcomes (e.g. infectious diseases, health behaviors, etc.). I also focus on computational 
aspects of epidemiology. My work has ranged from assessing the performance of estimators through simulation studies to 
collection of contact network data with electronic sensors to application of causal inference in the context of 
infectious disease and social epidemiology. 

I received my PhD in epidemiology from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and my MPH in 
epidemiology from The Ohio State University. 

My website provides a highlighted selection of publications, presentations, and software I have written. For a full 
summary of all my previous work, please see my CV.

### Current Research

The following is a brief summary of my ongoing research projects or current research interests.

#### Non-standard causal inference

Within epidemiology, the assumption of causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity are often relied on for 
identification of causal effects. My interests lie in how we can substitute or avoid these assumptions. Examples 
include proximal causal inference, causal inference with interference, fusion designs, machine learning, and 
semi-empirical modeling. 

#### Estimating equations

A set of powerful tools for statistical analyses are estimating equations. An ongoing interest is in application of 
these tools for epidemiologic analyses and to ease their adoption by epidemiologists. My main contribution in this 
area has been the development of [delicatessen](https://deli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for general 
application of estimating equations.

At the Society of Epidemiologic Research 2023 (Portland, OR), I will be leading a workshop titled "ABC's of 
M-estimation", which will serve as a primer on estimating equations for applied researchers.

#### Infectious diseases

My applied work focuses on infectious disease epidemiology. Previous and ongoing research have focused on influenza,
HIV, SARS-CoV-2, and vaccines. My main interest is how observational studies on vaccine effectiveness can be improved.
