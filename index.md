# About

<img align="right" src="assets/images/paul_zivich_min.JPG" alt="Me" width="300">

Paul is a postdoctoral trainee at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in the Institute of Global Health and 
Infectious Diseases. His interests are in causal inference with potential outcomes, with specialization in the context 
of networks and contagious outcomes (e.g. infectious diseases, health behaviors, etc.). Dr. Zivich also focuses on 
computational aspects of epidemiology. His work has ranged from assessing the performance of estimators through 
simulation studies to free and open source software (FOSS) to collection of contact network data with electronic 
sensors to application of causal inference in the context of infectious disease and social epidemiology.

Paul received his PhD in epidemiology from University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and his MPH in 
epidemiology from The Ohio State University. He was born, is conducting research, and will die.

## Current Research

The following is a brief summary of my ongoing research projects or current research interests.

### Non-standard causal inference

Within epidemiology, the assumption of causal consistency, exchangeability, and positivity are often relied on for 
identification of causal effects. My interests lie in how we can revise or avoid these assumptions. Examples of my work
in this area include 
[proximal causal inference](https://academic.oup.com/aje/advance-article/doi/10.1093/aje/kwad077/7098281), 
[causal inference with interference](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.9525), 
[fusion designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04445), 
[machine learning](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8012235/), 
and
[semi-empirical modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01572). 

### Estimating equations

A set of powerful tools for statistical analyses are estimating equations. An ongoing interest is in application of 
these tools for epidemiologic analyses and to ease their adoption by epidemiologists. My main contribution in this 
area has been the development of [delicatessen](https://deli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a Python library for general 
application of estimating equations.

Other examples of my work in this area include
[M-estimators for bridged treatment comparisons](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00845),
[M-estimators for fusion designs](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/192/3/467/6564140),
[M-estimators for sensitivity analyses](https://journals.lww.com/epidem/Abstract/9900/Sensitivity_Analyses_for_Means_or_Proportions_with.139.aspx),
and
[M-estimators for g-computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10976).

### Infectious diseases

My applied work focuses on infectious disease epidemiology. My main interest is how observational studies on vaccine 
effectiveness can be improved. Previous and ongoing research have focused on 
[influenza](https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/9p290j79m),
[pneumonia](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41479-018-0055-4),
HIV, 
[SARS-CoV-2](https://www.researchprotocols.org/2021/4/e25410), 
[testing](https://academic.oup.com/aje/article/192/2/246/6759402),
and 
[vaccines](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10995-016-2201-z).
