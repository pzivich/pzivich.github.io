# Software 

I am a supporter of open-source software and believe it will lead to better and more trustworthy science. Below are 
some of my open-source contributions.

------------------

## Python

### zEpid

I am the creator of the [zEpid](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid) Python library, a open-source library for 
epidemiologic analyses and quantitative causal inference. Various tutorials are available 
[here](https://github.com/pzivich/Python-for-Epidemiologists/tree/master/3_Epidemiology_Analysis) and replications of
published analyses using zEpid are [here](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid-replications)

### Delicatessen

Another of my Python libraries is [delicatessen](https://github.com/pzivich/Delicatessen), a Python library for 
generalized M-estimation. Some tutorials demonstrating the utility and flexibility are provided 
[here](https://deli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples.html).

## Open-Source Analyses

I am also a supporter of open-source code for scientific publications. I make my analytic code for publications 
available [here](https://github.com/pzivich/publications-code).
