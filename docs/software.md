# Software 

I am the creator of the [zEpid](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid) Python library, a open-source library for 
epidemiologic analyses and quantitative causal inference, and [delicatessen](https://github.com/pzivich/Delicatessen), 
a Python library for generalized M-estimation.

I also make most of my analytic code for publications available [here](https://github.com/pzivich/publications-code)
