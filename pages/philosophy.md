### Mission Statement

To better understand the world through kindness, persistence, and curiosity in order to improve it.

### Philosophy

This section is meant to briefly outline elements of my personal philosophy with which I view the world. My thoughts 
here are disjoint and a continual work in-progress. They will undoubtedly need to be revised (and I welcome you 
reader to challenge them and ask me to justify them further).

#### Ontology

Arthur Schopenhauer, Charles Peirce, Bishop Berkeley, and others provide arguments that materialism cannot be proven. 
As all I have access to are my perceptions and a proof of materialism would require me to go beyond those perceptions, 
I am unable to make progress here. In a more modern illustration of this idea, I cannot prove that I am not in a 
computer simulation. As proofs of necessity for materialism or idealism (or others) seem unlikely to come about 
(as either quickly becomes circular), it appears to me that one must make an assumption as the starting point. I assume 
a materialist framework from a pragmatic perspective. Whether I live in a computer simulation or am the figment of 
some being, ultimately does not matter. I do not have access to that 'other level'. I must make decisions in the 
context I am in and those decisions always have had consequences in 'this level', so I want to make the best decisions 
in the context I have access to. When I return to my office after the weekend, I expect all my items to be in the 
places I left them (I am surprised when they move, but it always seems to have a causal explanation accessible to my 
level).

My preference for a materialist framework came about after reading Berkeley's *Principles of Human Knowledge*. 
While Berkeley had the opposite intention in his work, my preference comes about from the following reflections after 
reading his work:

- Conflict resolution under materialism is possible. Specifically, two parties can argue over an external object, 
  independent of either. In my reading, Berkeley seems to rely on the existence of a deity to organize perceptions to 
  cohere between different minds. Without intervention of such a deity, it is unclear how we can resolve conflicts 
  (if we both just have perceptions, then neither of us is wrong and both are right). By having an external world that 
  we perceive as our foundation, we then have a reference point to make progress on resolving disagreements. How (and 
  whether) those disagreements can be solved is another issue entirely, but materialism offers an opportunity to that
  does not require as large of a leap in existence (in my opinion).
- To me, scientific progress appears to be better justified under a materialist framework. If all that is, is 
  perceptions, then I'm not sure what science or observations can hope to capture. If we instead are viewing an external 
  world through (distorted) perceptions, then it seems like science has something to say beyond the perceiver. The 
  success of science seems to give the adoption of materialism weight.

While I choose to adopt a materialist viewpoint, I recognize this is a singular assumption one can make regarding their 
ontology. I could have instead chosen an idealist viewpoint. Such an opposing view may allow scientific progress not 
otherwise possible under a materialist viewpoint (I do not find this to be likely, hence my materialist preference, 
but I am open to being shown that I am wrong). So as Feyerabend would demand of me, I make no restrictions on the
ontologies others select.

#### Epistemology

I find epistemological anarchism, or 'anything goes' appealing to allow myself (and others) flexibility in scientific 
progress. As someone who works on novel methods, it is helpful to have this flexibility. 

#### Causal Model

The causal model I operate under is Jamie Robins's FFRCISTG (Finest Fully Randomized Causally Interpreted Structured 
Tree Graph). While this model agrees with Judea Pearl's NP-SEM (Non-Parametric Structural Equation Model) for most of 
my work, I adopt FFRCISTG as I am skeptical that natural direct and indirect effects can be identified. As such, I 
choose FFRCISTG. While the FFRCISTG is incapable of handling effects of truly continuous variables, I do not believe
that truly continuous variables exist in the world. I think continuous variables are a nice mathematical 
approximation that we use, but they are only a helpful fiction. So, I do not seem the need to adopt the 
MCM (Minimal Causal Model) of Richardson and Robins.

#### Probability

I continue to struggle with what 'probability' is, despite using it all throughout my work. I recognize the objections 
to frequentism and some of the flaws it has. However, I am also not a Bayesian. To me, Sir David Cox's objection 
described in *Theoretical Statistics* (i.e., there is no guarantee that any answers obtained are connected to the truth 
of that system) seems quite damning. My current interest lies in viewing probability as information, and probability 
as an extension of logic to uncertainty (see Łukasiewicz's writings). My ideas here are not fully formed.

#### Moral Philosophy

Morally, I adopt a utilitarian framework. Deriving maxims (without error for all eternity) seems hopeless to me (as 
even Kant seemingly couldn't meet this task), especially since it seems easy to get trapped in the 'morality of your 
time' (again Kant). I recognize the possible errors of a utilitarian framework (e.g., the utility monster), but I do 
not think these objections as disastrous. Instead, I think thye show that we should be careful in how we define 
utility. The best way to safeguard against utility monsters appears to me to be a democratic society. I also think
a utilitarian framework that allows for uncertainty (as we often are) can help address these challenges.

#### Consciousness

I find the emergent property explanation to be convincing. So, I also accept animal consciousness and machine 
consciousness as possible. In fact, I believe that animal's do have a form of consciousness at varying degrees that 
likely depends on their sensory perceptions and neural structure. Regarding machines, I do believe it is possible (I 
take von Neumann's point that the limitation of making a machine 'think' is our not knowing what 'thinking' actually 
consists of). However, I do not believe that the current generation of LLMs (large languages models) are close nor 
are thinking (in the human sense).
