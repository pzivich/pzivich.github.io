I am a supporter of open-source software and believe it will lead to better and more trustworthy science. Below are 
some of my open-source contributions.

------------------

## Python


### zEpid

I am the creator of the [zEpid](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid) Python library, a open-source library for 
epidemiologic analyses and quantitative causal inference. Various tutorials are available 
[here](https://github.com/pzivich/Python-for-Epidemiologists/tree/master/3_Epidemiology_Analysis) and replications of
published analyses using zEpid are [here](https://github.com/pzivich/zEpid-replications).


### Delicatessen

I am also the creator of [delicatessen](https://github.com/pzivich/Delicatessen), a Python library for generalized 
M-estimation. Some tutorials demonstrating the utility and flexibility are provided 
[here](https://deli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Examples.html). An associated pre-print is available on 
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11300).


### MossSpider

[MossSpider](https://github.com/pzivich/MossSpider) is a Python library for targeted maximum likelihood estimation with
network-dependent data and stochastic policies. This library is part of my dissertation work.  Details and examples are
provided [here](https://mossspider.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Open-Source Data Analyses

I am also a supporter of open-source code for scientific publications. I make my analytic code for publications 
available [here](https://github.com/pzivich/publications-code).
